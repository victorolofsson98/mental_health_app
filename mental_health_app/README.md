# The application - An overview

Our product is aimed to ensure healthy lives and promote the mental health well being
for all who use our product at all ages, according to UN’s sustainable development
goals, covid-19 had a big impact on the mental health of the world, and a lack of data
and insight to people's mental health made it difficult to really understand the impact of
the pandemic.

Our product will gather insightful data about a user/patient, so that a mental health clinic, and
the user/patient, can track how the patient feels on a daily basis. Combining the application
use with the help from a mental health professional will help the progress of a patient's
mental health and the application will also aid the mental health clinic to keep track of
how their patient feels and aid them with diagnosis and if the patient needs further help.
To make our application fitting for all age groups, it will be built with a simple and
functional user interface, with clear instructions on how to use the application and how
you can get help quickly if needed. It will also be simple to analyze your own feelings
and for the mental health clinic to gather insightful data from those feelings to make a
professional diagnosis.

User information will be private, no third party information collection, only the mental
health clinic will, if allowed by the user, have access to the users data. The application is
solely made to help individuals suffering from mental health issues, it will be free of charge for
anyone to use.

For continued development of the application it will be sold to private and government
funded institutions so that they can refer their patient to use this application to gather
insightful data, so that it is still free for everyone.

# What does the medical community think?

"In recent years, mental health issues have become a major source of concern in our society due to the increases in its occurrence and the devastating effects it has on the individual, their loved ones, and society as a whole. According to a survey by the World Health Organization—Mental Health, approximately 350 million individuals suffer from depression yearly.

Digital health tools provide the opportunity to make health services accessible and more engaging. Specifically, smartphones and other handheld mobile devices are an attractive platform for delivering mental health interventions because of their ubiquitous nature coupled with their increased capacity to process and handle a large amount of data, deliver instant feedback, and share data with the healthcare providers and researchers.

There are many applications designed to support mental health issues. Popular examples include apps that enable self-monitoring of personal mental health–related data such as mood14 and mental health games–based apps that help to manage anxiety and achieve healthy living.15 There are also many more apps available on the App Store and Google Play that are targeted at promoting mental health and tackling various mental health issues. These apps use various techniques including tracking and monitoring to improve personal insight about causes and symptoms of mental illness, providing techniques to mitigate and manage symptoms emerging as a result of a mental health issue such as breathing and meditation, and providing a social community where users can ask and/or answer questions and find support."
